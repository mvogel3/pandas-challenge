Berkeley Data Bootcamp module 4 challenge

The data used in this analysis tracked 39, 170 students across 15 schools in a single school district. The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether the size of the school, the type of school, and/or the amount of money spent by the school could be reasonably said to impact the reading and writing scores of high school students.

Beginning with the district data, math scores across all schools are on average 78% or a C+ with roughly 75% of students holding a passing math grade. Reading scores averaged at 82% or a low B and 86% of students holding a passing grade or higher. That stated, the data showed that only 65% of students in the district were passing both math and reading consecutively. Information regarding the year this data was produced and where this district was located would be beneficial to understanding how it is performing in comparison to other American school districts. 

When breaking the data down to each school, a pattern begins to emerge. Out of the 15 schools, 7 of them had overall passing rates between 50% and 55%. The remaining schools had overall passing rates between 89% and 92% so a huge disparity exists in this district. The top 5 schools were all charter schools and the bottom 5 were all district schools. Further exploration showed that district schools accounted for all the 50%-55% passing rate schools. It is evident that the type of school is a large contributing factor.
